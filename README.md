# Scriptable Object Study Project
I created this project for studying scriptable object in Unity at October 2022. 

I used Unity's Roll-a-Ball project as a base and develop gameplay on top of it.

You can play from [there!](https://erkamuzuncayir.itch.io/roll-a-ball)

I used two Unite videos that I added links of them at the below as a guide.
